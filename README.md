# ISUmonarch

This repository is being used to store some of the data for the 
[Iowa Monarch Conservation Consortium](https://monarch.ent.iastate.edu/).
The structure is a [package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) for the statistical 
computing software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) which makes loading the data
in R easy.
For non-R users, the data can be downloaded from the 
[repository releases](https://github.com/ISU-Monarchs/HabitatRestoration/releases).
The R package utilizes 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and recording keeping.
The website <http://github.com> hosts the Git repository.
