# ISUmonarch

This repository is being used to store some of the data for the 
[Iowa Monarch Conservation Consortium](https://monarch.ent.iastate.edu/).
The structure is a [package](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) for the statistical 
computing software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) which makes loading the data
in R easy.
The R package utilizes 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and recording keeping.
The website <github.com> hosts the Git repository.

## People

Currently 
[Jarad Niemi](https://monarch.ent.iastate.edu/people/jarad-niemi) and 
[Seth Applegate](https://monarch.ent.iastate.edu/people/seth-appelgate)
are in charge of data entry while
