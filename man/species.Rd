\description{
This data set contains flowering forb species common and scientific names, native status, planted vs non planted species, and species specific counting units for all flowering plant species which were currently flowering at the time of data collection.
These species are present in the 'nectar', 'bee', and 'environment' datasets.  
Only ACTIVELY BLOOMING/FLOWERING forb species are included in this list.
No data in this project attempts to quantify species which flower but were not at the time of data colleciton.
Data collection does not include flowering grasses.
