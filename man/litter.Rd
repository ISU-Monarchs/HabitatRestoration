\section{Data Collection Protocol}{


**Note** Daubenmire and robel data share the same directory and are both saved with the same file name except that robel data is saved with a '2' after the .csv extension.
site_transect_round.csv2

Daubenmire survey was done at 10m lengths along a permanent transect line

Observer placed a quadrant (1 meter x 0.5m rectangle) on the left side of the transect

Quadrant was placed with 1 meter edge perpendicular to the 100m tape and 0.5 meter edge extending from transect point to 0.5 meters along transect length. 

Observations started at 0 meters on the transect and were taken every 10m of the transect. 

Observations were at a point on the transect and did not encompass the full length of a section.

Data collection began at 0 meter starting point of the transect and stopped before the transect ended.

A transect length of 100m will have points recorded for 0 meters through 90 meters; 10 points.

Data is not taken at the final point on the transect as this area is outside the transect. 

Some litter values were only given as <.25, <.5, or >.5. 
The inequalities have been removed, but are available in \code{\link{daubenmire_raw}}.
