Nectar plants were surveyed by an observer walking along a permanent transect line. Observer walked a line parallel to the transect at a length of 1.5m to the right of the transect. Observer visually surveyed a 1m wide band along the whole length of the transect, recording every visual detection of a blooming floral resource.

If no nectar plants are present for entry, header is present but no plants are listed.

Transect length
  
    Transect length differed between sites. Transect length ranged from 30 meters to 100 meters in length. See files in 'survey' folder, to determine transect length for each site.

    Transect length sometimes differed at the same site across different rounds. See files in 'survey' folder to determine transect length for each site.

        transect length changed as noted in 'survey2016' at sites: cre1, nkn1, nkn2, sie1, pre1a 

        transect length changed at sut2 and pre1a between round 3 2016 and round 1 2017
        
        transect length remained the same at all sites from round 1 2017 and following
Section length 

    2016- see datasheet or 'survey2016' document to determine if sections were 10 meters or 20 meters in length in 2016. 

    All sections were 10 meter lengths in 2017 and years following

Meter sections

    Denotes meter section in which ‘nectar plant species’ occurred

‘Nectar Plant Species’

    Plants were identified using a guide developed by Seth Appelgate, based on available online guides.

    The floral resource (or nectar plant) was recorded by its common name. 

    Numbers are count data, counting total number of nectar species counting units for each species by section. If nectar species were present at high densities counting may have been by 5, 10, 20, 50 or other large units.

    ‘Nectar Plant Species’ common names and corresponding scientific names

    ‘Nectar Plant Species’ field count unit 

        Specific to each species. Counting units are either umbel, head, ramet, or spike and are listed in the column ‘field_count_unit’.

    Classification of plants as either native, introduced, or both as defined by the USDA PLANTS database.

    Classification as either planted or non planted. Indicating which species were in the native seed mix planted.

    smartweed: observers were not able to identify smartweed species with confidence. Some observers attempted to identify by species from 2016-2018 and physical data sheets reflect these attempts. Decision was made to rename all species as smartweed and to proceed with only identifying plants as smartweed. It is highly likely that the smartweed species being identified are one of the four species listed by their scientific name in the 'nectar_species...' file

2017 and Years Following Notes

  ‘common_milkweed_ramet’ ‘swamp_milkweed_ramet’ ‘butterfly_milkweed_ramet’
    
    count data of milkweed ramets for each milkweed species within the 1m wide sampling area. Milkweed ramet was counted regardless of whether or not it was flowering. 
    
    Survey is not technically a part of the ‘nectar’ survey but was included on the data sheet for because area covered was exact same as ‘nectar’ data

    Length of transect as noted in files within 'survey' folder can be used to calculate density. Detected milkweed ramets/transect length = milkweed ramets/m2 for each species.

  ‘milkweed strip: common milkweed ramet’

    Count data of common milkweed ramets observed in 1m strip along edge of plot

    Only at sites: all2 (north edge), arm1 (south edge), ber3 (east edge), nkn1 (south edge)

    Milkweed strip was a 1m wide strip that ran the length of the plot where only common milkweed was planted.
