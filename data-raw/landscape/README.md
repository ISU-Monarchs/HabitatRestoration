Landscape surveyed the area outside the perimeter of the plot to determine if milkweed and flowering plants were present. Physical data sheet also listed ‘type of habitat’ which was outside the plot but this data was too ambiguous to be used so it was not recorded in the Git ‘landscape’ data set. Plot perimeter was not established until round 3 2016 data collection. Round 1/2 landscape surveyed area was at the discretion of the observer as to what was ‘outside’ the plot.

Landscape data only exists for 2016. In 2017 and following years, data collection relating to the outside of the plot is stored in the 'environment' data set. 'environment' data set is very different than 'landscape' 2016 data.

Weather data: Round 1 2016 Weather data which was recorded on the physical ‘landscape’ data sheets was recorded in the Git ‘monarch’ data set and not in the Git ‘landscape’ data set. ‘landscape’ weather data used correct formatting. ‘monarch’ physical data sheet line items were incorrect in round 1 2016. Weather data line items were removed from ‘landscape’ data sheets after round 1 2016. Physical data sheet line items were resolved for ‘monarch’ data set and weather data was recorded in ‘monarch’ data set for round 2 and 3 2016. All 2017 and following years weather data was recorded in ‘environment’ data set and in no other data set.
