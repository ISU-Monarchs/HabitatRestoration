For 2016 only:

  plot outline 
    
    round 1/2, only the transect location was decided. No plot edges had been established.
  
  wind
  
      Round1:    calm, light, moderate, very windy
    
      Round2/3:  calm, breeze, moderate breeze, too windy to monitor
    
  temp
      
      Data was collected from nearest weather station using various apps accessible via mobile device       at time of data collection 
  
  start_time, end_time
  
      Written in ##:##AM or ##:##PM format
    
      If hour was a single number, a zero was not written in front.
      
          Example: 8:45AM was written, not 08:45AM
      
  Sections were only used for round 1/2 data 2016.
    
      An observation within a section indicates the number of an adult monarchs observed within the plot while standing in the section noted. 
      
      Section length: 2016- see spreadsheet to determine if sections were 10m or 20m. 2017,2018            section length always 10m.

  Bins were only used for round 3 data 2016
      
      An observation indicates that an adult monarch was observed at that distance from the recorder
  
  'watch_monarch' is a monarch seen during the monitoring time, off the transect. This data only exists for round 1/2 data in 2016 and was not listed as a line item on the data sheets. This data only exists if the observer voluntarily wrote down this observation.
  
  
  'stems' is the number of milkweed ramets observed with a limit of 0 - 20 ramets. Milkweed species was not specified but was almost always common milkweed. If 'stems' = 0, no rows for 'eggs' or 'instars' are listed
  
  
For all years:

  'extra_monarch' in 2016 or 'extra_monarchs' in all other years is a monarch seen outside the monitoring time, anywhere at the site. This data will exist for all years, all sites.
  
  'extra_monarch' in 2016 or 'extra monarchs' in all other years is always a number, never 'NA'
  
  
  If 'wind', 'sky', or 'temp' were unfavorable monarch data was not collected:
  
      'NA' was entered for 'start_time' and 'end_time'
      
      'NA' was entered for monarch numbers by 'bin' or meter section or 'watch_monarch'
      
      'stems', 'eggs', and 'instar' data were still collected regardless of weather
      

Missing data and issues

2016
      
      transect length changed as noted in '2016_survey_dates_transect_lengths' at sites: cre1, nkn1, nkn2, sie1, pre1a 
 
2016 Round 3: ber3, dun2, har1, van2, fis1, vos1, jon1
  
      'stems', 'eggs', 'instar' data was collected on 8/11/2016 but adult monarch data was not taken because of rain. Adult monarch data was sampled on 8/17/2016 to make up for missed data. No 'stems', 'eggs', 'instar' data was collected on 8/17/2016.
  
2016 Round 1: Data is NA for uth3 as site did not yet exist.

2017

     transect length remained the same as round 3 2016 except at sut2 and pre1a
2017, 2018

     transect length remained the same across all surveys

2017 Round 3 8-15-17 fis1. No survey, rain
      
      'NA' was entered for 'start_time', '#_inside_plot', '#_outside_plot', 'extra_monarchs'

2017 Round 3: Cra1 was resampled 8-30-17 from original date of 8-15-17
