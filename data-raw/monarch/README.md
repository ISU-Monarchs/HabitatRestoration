Cory Haggard is in charge of this directory.


For 2016 only:

  Wind
  
      Round1:     calm, light, moderate, very windy
    
      Round 2/3:  calm, breeze, moderate breeze, too windy to monitor
    
  start_time, end_time
  
      Written in ##:##AM or ##:##PM
    
      If hour was a single number, a zero was not written in front.
      
          Example: 8:45 was written, not 08:45
      
  Sections were only used for round 1/2 data.
  
  'watch_monarch' is a monarch seen during the monitoring time, off the transect. This data only exists for round 1/2 data.
  
  Bins were only used for round 3 data.
  
  'stems' is a number from 0 - 20



  
For all years:

  'extra_monarch' is a monarch seen outside the monitoring time, anywehre at the site. This data will exist for all years, all sites.
  
  'extra_monarch' is always a number, never 'NA'
  
  If 'stems' = 0, no rows for 'eggs' or 'instars' are listed
  
  If 'wind', 'sky', or 'temp' were unfavorable and monarch data was not collected:
  
      'NA' was entered for 'start_time' and 'end_time'
      
      'NA' was entered for monarch numbers by 'bin' or meter section or 'watch_monarch
      
      'stems', 'eggs', and 'instar' data were still collected regardless of weather
      
  Round 3 for ber3, dun2, har1, van2, fis1, vos1, jon1
  
      'stems', 'eggs', 'instar' data was collected on 8/11/2016 but adult monarch data was not taken because of rain. Adult monarch data was sampled on 8/17/2016 to make up for missed data. No 'stems', 'eggs', 'instar' data was collected on 8/17/2016.
